# CDK STARTER FRONTEND

This is a frontend to CdkStarterBackend app at: https://github.com/FeroHriadel/cdk-starter-backend.git
It's basically a cheatsheet so you can start with cdk quickly

The code is a bit of a mess for which I apologize but it was done hastily not really knowing in advance what aws-cdk backend will throw at me :( 

## FEATURES
- amplify
- typescript
- sass
- react-bootstrap
- react-icons
- redux-toolkit
- context
